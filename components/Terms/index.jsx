            THESE TERMS OF USE ARE IMPORTANT AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, SO
            PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY. WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE TERMS
            INCLUDE AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH WILL, WITH LIMITED

            AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION
            AGREEMENT: (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AND SEEK

            AND (2) YOU ARE AGREEING TO MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION FOR THE

            Unless otherwise indicated in writing by us, the Service and all
            content and other materials contained therein, including, without

            licensors or users, as applicable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, the Service
            and Content may include software components provided by Digital Twin
            or its affiliates or a third party that are subject to separate
            license terms, in which case those license terms will govern such
            software components.
          </p>
          <p>
            SECTION 2 - TITLE AND OWNERSHIP <br />
            Title to, and ownership of, all NFTs passes from the supplier to the
            purchaser. If redeemed, it is the jewelry brand’s sole
            responsibility to ship and/or arrange for shipping of the physical
            asset. By arranging for transportation or shipping of any jewelry
            item under your instructions, we are providing a service to, and
            acting on behalf of you, or the purchaser of another party. By
            having us arrange the shipping on your behalf, you are also
            representing that you are acting in a fashion compliant with the
            laws and regulations of your State, municipality and any other State
            that apply to you and the purchase, shipping, transportation and
            delivery of the item. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO MAKE THE REPRESENTATIONS
            AND WARRANTIES IN THIS PARAGRAPH, DO NOT redeem. You affirm and
            represent that you have obtained any and all required permission or
            consent, paid any required fees, and are working through properly
            licensed intermediaries where required, and you, or the purchaser or
            other intended or actual recipient, is entitled to receive and take
            possession of the jewelry.
          </p>
          <p>
            SECTION 3 - NFT REDEMPTION <br />
            Each NFT does not represent ownership in the actual physical asset
            it corresponds to. Each NFT is an independent work of art purchased
            directly from the brand. The owner of each NFT has the ability to
            apply for an exchange/redemption of the digital to the physical.
            Each redeemer is also responsible for importation and customs laws.
            All redemptions are final and may not be reversed.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the product cannot be redeemed, the NFT will remain in the
            custody of the attempted redeemer. If there is a mandatory
            redemption date set and the redeemer does not respond to Digital
            Twin, Digital Twin reserves the right to update the tokenURI to
            highlight the NFT only exists in its Digital form and is no longer
            asset-backed. Before doing so, Digital Twin will post on social
            channels to highlight the mandatory redemption date.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, Digital Twin retains the ability to take back
            possession of the NFT. This is merely a security measure and can
            only be done in 2 scenarios. 1) The NFT owner violates Digital
            Twin’s terms and conditions. 2) As a security measure for a consumer
            who loses access to their digital wallet.
          </p>

          <p>
            SECTION 4 - CHOICE OF LAW; ARBITRATION; AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. The
            internal laws of Delaware, without regard to any otherwise
            applicable choice of laws principles, shall govern any action
            related to these Terms of Service, the use of the digitalxtwin.io
            site or the Digital Twin business.
          </p>

          <p>
            YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS ARE
            LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
          </p>

          <p>
            SECTION 5 - CLASS ACTION WAIVER
            <br />
            ARBITRATION MUST BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. THIS MEANS THAT NEITHER
            YOU NOR DIGITAL TWIN MAY JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION
            BY OR AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS, OR LITIGATE IN COURT OR ARBITRATE
            ANY CLAIMS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE
            ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY.
          </p>

          <p>
            SECTION 6 - AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE <br />
            In the event of a dispute between you and us arising under or
            relating to the Digitalxtwin.io site or the Digital Twin business,
            you hereby acknowledge and agree that by using the digitalxtwin.io
            site, you are irrevocably agreeing to resolve any such dispute or
            claim through binding arbitration, as described below, instead of
            bringing an action in court. THIS MEANS THAT NEITHER PARTY SHALL
            HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH DISPUTE OR CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE
            A JURY TRIAL.
          </p>

          <p>
            SECTION 19 - VALIDATING YOUR ORDER
            <br />
            After you place an order for physical redemption, we will check the
            information you give us for validity and compliance with state laws
            and regulations, by verifying your method of payment or shipping
            address. We reserve the right to reject any order you place with us,
            and/or to limit quantities on any order, without giving any reason.
            If we reject your order, we will attempt to notify you using the
            e-mail address you have given us with the order. Your credit or
            debit card will normally not be charged if we reject an order, but
            we will process a refund if the charge has been made against your
            card.
          </p>

            SECTION 20 - ORDER ACCEPTANCE/CONFIRMATION
            <br />
            Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation
            does not signify an acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute
            confirmation of an offer to sell. The licensed retailer fulfilling
            your order reserves the right at any time after receipt of your
            order to accept or decline your order for any reason.
          </p>

          <p>
            SECTION 21 - RETURN POLICY
            <br />
            All sales are final and cannot be returned. However, if your item is
            damaged or defective, these exceptions do not apply. In this case,
            Digital Twin and its affiliates will take care of it and work with
            you to find the best solution. Questions? Please contact our Support
            Team: support@digitalxtwin.io
          </p>

          <p>
            SECTION 22 - ORDER LIMITATIONS
            <br />
            We reserve the right to reject any order you place with us and/or or
            to limit quantities in any order, without giving any reason or for
            no reason, if we determine it is in our best interests to do so. If
            we reject your order or reduce the quantities of any items in your
            order, we will attempt to notify you using the e-mail and/or billing
            address you gave us when you placed the order.
          </p>

          <p>
            We and/or the licensed retailers may, at our own discretion, limit
            or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per
            order. We also reserve the right to reject any order you place via
            the digitalxtwin.io site. These restrictions may include orders
            placed by the same Web site account, the same credit card, and
            orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the
            event we make a change to an order, we will attempt to notify you by
            contacting the e-mail and/or billing address provided at the time
            the order was made. We and/or the licensed retailers that fulfill
            your orders reserve the right to limit or prohibit sales to dealers.
          </p>

          <p>
            SECTION 23 - SHIPPING
            <br />
            All orders placed on our site are subject to product availability
            and will be shipped according to Digital Twin’s shipping policies.
            In the event your order never arrives, notification of lost items
            must be received within 30 days from receipt of the shipping
            confirmation email. At the end of redemption service: Redeemer will
            be required to pay shipping fees and duties upon redemption. <br />
            If the product cannot be redeemed the NFT will remain in the custody
            of the attempted redeemer. If there is a mandatory redemption date
            set and the redeemer does not respond to Digital Twin, Digital Twin
            reserves the right to update the tokenURI to highlight the NFT only
            exists in its Digital form and is no longer asset-backed. Before
            doing so, Digital Twin will post on social channels to highlight the
            mandatory redemption date. In the event Digital Twin goes out of
            business, all live NFT collections will be finalized with a
            redemption window. Digital Twin will use commercially reasonable
            efforts to ensure NFT holders are aware of impending redemption
            windows to claim physical products. Once NFT holders have redeemed
            the physical items, Digital Twin and its affiliates will ship the
            product to the client.
          </p>

          <p>
            SECTION 24 - ERRORS ON OUR SITE
            <br />
            Prices and availability of products and services are subject to
            change without notice. Errors will be corrected where discovered and
            we have the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for products
            and/or services listed at an incorrect price, rebate or refund or
            other promotional offer or containing any incorrect information or
            typographical errors. We have the right to refuse or cancel any such
            orders, whether or not the order has been confirmed and/or your
            credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged
            for the purchase and your order is canceled, we shall issue a credit
            to your credit card account in the amount of the charge. Individual
            bank policies will dictate when this amount is credited to your
            account.

            SECTION 30 – INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
            <br />
            Intellectual Property (“IP”) of this NFT product remains with the
            brand. Any intellectual property created as a result of this
            transaction belongs to the brand. This NFT is not a license to use
            the IP. This NFT does not represent actual ownership in the physical
            asset. This NFT represents proof of authenticity, verification of
            ownership, and the right to apply for redemption of the physical
            asset. If the conditions are satisfied for redemption, redemption is
            guaranteed.
          </p>

          <p>
            NFTs on Digital Twin correspond to a physical asset or rights to a
            future physical asset; and may include the rights to a future
            experience. Brands can set an &quot;earliest redemption date&quot; in which
            case the NFT cannot be exchanged for the corresponding physical
            asset immediately. The earliest redemption date is not binding, but
            acts as an estimation. Brands may require NFT owners to burn their
            NFTs in order to access the rest of the package.
