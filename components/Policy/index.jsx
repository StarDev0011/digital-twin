            Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before
            responding to such requests.
            <br />
            You have the right to complain to a Data Protection Authority about
            our collection and use of your Personal Information. For more
            information, please contact your local data protection authority in
            the European Economic Area (EEA). California Consumer Privacy
            Protection Act (“CCPA”)
            <br />
            If you are a resident of California, you have certain information
            protection rights under the Consumer Privacy Protection Act
            (“CCPA”). We aim to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct,
            amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Information. If you
            wish to be informed what Personal Information, we hold about you and
            if you want it to be removed from our systems, please contact us.
            <br />
            Under the Consumer Privacy Protection Act, you have the following
            data protection rights:
            <br />
            The right to access data. This right to access data grants a person
            the ability to request that a business confirm whether it has
            personal information about him or her, the type of personal
            information that the business keeps about the individual, and/or a
            copy of the specific information that the business has on file. For
            inquiries click the following link: What information do you have on
            me? The right to be forgotten. The right to be forgotten grants the
            ability of a person to request that a business delete the personal
            information that it holds about them.
            <br />
            The right to opt-out from having information sold. The right to
            opt-out grants to the ability of a person to direct that a business
            cannot sell the personal information that it holds about them.
            <br />
            The right to opt-in to having information sold. The right to opt-in
            refers to the requirement within the CCPA that a business cannot
            sell the personal information of a consumer that is less than 16
            years old unless the business has received “opt-in” consent – i.e.,
            affirmative authorization for the sale of the information. If a
            child is between the ages of 13 and 16, they can provide the
            necessary opt-in consent directly to the business. If a child is
            under the age of 13, a parent or guardian must provide the consent.
            The right to receive services on equal terms. The right to receive
            services on equal terms prevents us from discriminating against you
            when exercising your rights under the CCPA.
            <br />
            In order to exercise your right under the CCPA, you may make a
            request to have any personal data collected removed by clicking the
            following link: Do Not Sell My Personal Information. Requests to
            remove personal information will remove all past information
            collected. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity
            before responding to such requests.
          </p>
